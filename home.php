				<h1>An <em>Educational</em> Campus?</h1>
          <p>
            Does the phrase <em>“educational campus”</em> sound slightly redundant to you?
          </p>
          <p>
            I thought so too, when it first popped into my head, but the more I thought about it, the less true that seemed. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Think back to when you were in college - or maybe you are right now - when was the last time you learned something from your campus? I mean, you’ve probably learned a lot of things on your campus, but chances are, most of the lessons you learned in college could have been given in any tall grand-looking brick building - or for that matter, any building with classrooms in it at all. (That is, or course, aside from the ones that could have been learned in any campus-area bar, or any dormitory hallway - but we’re gonna steer away from those here.)

            The point is, when was the last time a professor took you outside and used the physical environment of the campus - this environment which is nominally for learning, into which so many millions of every university’s budget go for construction and upkeep - to actually teach something? 
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ll admit, the campus of the school I attended was an arboretum, as many are - which as far as I could tell growing up in this town, was a fancy word for “place with awesome trees which you are not allowed to climb” - and once, in undergraduate, a botany professor took the class outside to learn what various species looked like. But while she utilized the space effectively, it was not the use for which it had been intended, and, indeed, our walks had to inevitably began to stray far off campus in order to encompass very many native species, or demonstrations of plants in a natural habitat.

          <p>
            Now imagine that one, just one, say, of the fifty or so lawn-spaces on this university campus were converted back into a native ecosystem. A guided walk through it would not only provide a superior learning environment for students of local ecology, but also demonstrate a key 
          </p>
          <p>
            But if that’s such a good idea, why don’t more schools do it? The short answer is, that increasingly, they are. Schools, corporate campuses and municipalities all over the country are converting lawn-space back into native shrub or grassland, in response to pressures ranging from water shortages to grassroots pressure for sustainability. However, this trend represents a small percentage of institutions, and usually takes the form of pilot projects or other small-scale instances, failing entirely to shift the prevailing paradigm of the sacred-lawn.
